<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Shivani Daksh, a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and Java. Over the past year, I’ve worked on several projects, including a YouTube clone, an Amazon website clone, and a Sudoku solver using Java, all of which have deepened my knowledge of front-end technologies and programming.</p>

<p>'m always looking for new ways to challenge myself and improve my skills. Currently, I’m working on creating a mathematics tutorial website and building smaller projects to test and expand my capabilities. I love diving into complex problems and turning creative ideas into functional and responsive websites.
</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring the outdoors. One of my most memorable adventures was a trek in Tirthan Valley, where I discovered the beauty of nature after an icy, thrilling hike.
